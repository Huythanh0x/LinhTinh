However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.

SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.&nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.&nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.</p><p>If you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO)&nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing<strong> \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"J. Selva Antony Santosh\"</strong> is for you!&nbsp;This quiz also has the room for explanatory answers that it provides. It may be a tough test for you, still.</p><p><strong><em>All the very best to score well!</em></strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-01-17_09-57-22-1d4377761aeb3bccecfb09511fa190ec/1/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637082203&Signature=Hf-aCYrhJkfpp1DJp4~VNVavR5G0r~j2rzpRtG1FGdMHJHoTk~S0x06qAu6FSImMcg0k6SsiS02dWMEVHG1IQzmu~ce~UbfPtJ-wx60zDWL1pDZZQh3poyIG3SY~hHmIvJrt1lUZnhxUIu2NxOmlG8L3kDD~kizBeJqNrrZkg5Yr4l-V-b-8QwsP2AEX9NqsRPEDDyi15eGzwZwW9HQHqavQhDOaMJTIaFx6jjWMzWLAtAkqkqS7sGIbK4KPIrHWLurR0SzU6L8-CruiS-4HXUYmaiBFw0ttJSRHqrb3OeFiUk9eJbbmlIHkx5IDUAFzxtuG6ueCHGh1OKEWEhG8oQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "363378", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Media", "title": "Journalism: Conduct Great Media Interviews", "level": "All Levels", "author": "TJ Walker", "duration": "1 hour", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "88", "students": "16409", "coupon_code": "4AB2B3DFB796CD14ED8A", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/363378_e5fa_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-conduct-interviews/?couponCode=4AB2B3DFB796CD14ED8A", "end_day": "2021-11-20 20:01:06+00:00", "headline": "Journalism: You can conduct skillful video or audio interviews with experts, news makers or even colleagues", "description": "<p><strong>Journalism</strong>-you can become a skilled media interviewer.&nbsp;Imagine yourself conducting interviews with news-makers, industry experts and colleagues and appearing confident and authoritative the whole time.

We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.</p><p>The basics taught in this part will be fundamental in learning time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques on later part of this course.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Basics of Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, we will discuss about the basics of time series data, application of time series forecasting, and the standard process followed to build a forecasting model, time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Pre-processing Time Series Data</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn how to visualize time series, perform feature engineering, do re-sampling of data, and various other tools to analyze and prepare the data for models and execute time series forecasting, time series analysis and implement Python time series techniques.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 5 -</strong> <strong>Getting Data Ready for Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.</p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment and missing value imputation.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 6 - Forecasting using Regression Model</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 7 - Theoretical Concepts</strong></p></li></ul><p>This part will give you a solid understanding of concepts involved in Neural Networks.</p><p>In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Section 8 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills related to time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques to immediately see practical benefits in your work place.</p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1 of this course on time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques!</strong></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2020-03-12_13-39-50-cc4bf64c2dea96d9e7c5520dbc5a99dc/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1637082308&Signature=SrjVv~JkRzcxuX6MEo9QKAc5EazAbUNnYhW23BrLsZR3bf3DwbacAaVsMDdZ-h00E30g4eF-BNnXyyPlVwSe7eyz2GNEedRIfEgcvqPwGzIidkjcDJme-Xh9RjPW~5~7yP3zRtvFtYGRtlxD5jSFGjcAZkdQvpBGYtKyw1R3LV4WB7taDwEob7u0D4MKRnoY5Mhd1Zx10kO7f9Ps~F8m1oLMRrkrGFnBKpDIhL67P3yetCzeuwdI33orhZNOcSk0oVnit2lYJlT19YvnYUa2XzQVrjPh5N~V2KK44LJaS2pB0B2UZ6csSRxZXOcF84Gq1F~w-~N9RM9EeT6zrthrmg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "4115696", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Financial Modeling & Analysis", "title": "Corporate Finance #11 Capital Budgeting", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "14 hours", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "18", "students": "11172", "coupon_code": "2DAB35E4CD6B0ACC6FF9", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4115696_2d4e.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-finance-11-capital-budgeting/?couponCode=2DAB35E4CD6B0ACC6FF9", "end_day": "2021-11-20 05:31:04+00:00", "headline": "Learn how to make capital budgeting decisions from a certified public accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will show how to make capital budgeting decisions from a corporate finance perspective.</p><p>We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems.
