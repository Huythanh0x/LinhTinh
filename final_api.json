Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. </p><p>Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. </p><p>In this introduction to computer programming course, you\u2019ll learn and practice key computer science concepts. You\u2019ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you\u2019ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own programs.</p><p>This Computer science and programming using python course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.</p><p>Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece. And those steps can be executed by a computer.</p><p>In this course, we will not get into everything that you need to be a programmer, but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be <strong>fluently</strong> programming in Python and you'll be so good at Python that you can get a job or use the language professionally.</p><p>You'll cover all that you need to be an accomplished Python Programmer.

Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you. And the good news is that\u2026<br></p><p><strong>Now You Too Can Protect Yourself From not Becoming Insecure about your Acting Career and Quitting before breaking into the Industry.</strong><br></p><p>Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p>That's right, you no longer have to lie awake at night, worrying about how to nail the next role you want to go for.</p><p><br></p><p>Because when you know these Acting foundation secrets, the exact methods and techniques for consistently confident about your acting, mastering the craft and avoiding feeling disempowered, out of control or lost in performance, you'll finally have peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That's because you know exactly what you are doing every time you approach a new role or go to an audition.

You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career.

Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

Just look at what others are saying:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kathryn Raphael</strong></p><p>Sylvia Love Johnson is a force of nature with her passion and ability to break down acting techniques. I have appreciated her commitment and her ability to inspire, challenge and support young talent. My daughter has greatly benefited from the coaching sessions and precious advice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Margaret Leitch</strong></p><p>I would recommend Sylvia very, very highly as an acting career coach. Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one. The day I got to join her class and be taught. I learnt so much that I don't think I would have learnt anywhere else. My best part was the Archetypes. This deepens my character relationship with me. It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something. Something that you'll run away with and will change your thinking on approaching a character. She was so patient with me as it took me a bit of struggle to get the hang of it, which encouraged me a lot. Coach, I am so grateful for being part of my acting process. I can never take this part for granted. Thank you so much, and may God add you more wisdom to keep showering on us. I can't wait to make a film with you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>At this point, we both know that Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery is precisely what you've been looking for to take your passion for acting to the Next Level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It's precisely what you want.

It powers the most commonly used database engines like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MySQL. Simply put, If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people to get interesting data from the database. It is also an English-like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL queries easily.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL.

Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p><strong>What's special about this course?</strong></p><p>The course is created on the basis of three pillars of learning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Know (Study)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Do (Practice)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Review (Self feedback)</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong><em>Know</em></strong></p><p>We have created a set of concise and comprehensive videos to teach you all the SQL related skills you will need in your professional career.</p><p><strong>Do</strong></p><p>We also provide <strong>Exercises</strong> to complement the learning from the lecture video.

Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.</p></li><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basics, try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>What is BigQuery used for?</strong></p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong> is a web service from Google that is <strong>used for</strong> handling or analyzing big data. Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform. As a NoOps (no operations) data analytics service, <strong>Google BigQuery</strong> offers users the ability to manage data using fast SQL-like queries for real-time analysis.</p><p><strong>Is BigQuery free?</strong></p><p>For users of Google BigQuery the first 10GB of storage per month is free and the first 1TB of query per month is free. Post these limits, Google BigQuery is chargeable.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p>Google BigQuery is used by companies such as Spotify, The New York Times, Stack Etc.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4589192", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Hardware", "title": "Arduino Practice Test: Test your Arduino Knowledge", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Educational Engineering Team", "duration": "null", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "1373", "coupon_code": "D69A28D314A0FBED3E58", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4589192_d62f.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/arduino-practice-test-test-your-arduino-knowledge/?source=coursemetry.com&couponCode=D69A28D314A0FBED3E58", "end_day": "2022-04-01 13:04:00+00:00", "headline": "Work on exercises and projects to improve your Arduino skills", "description": "<p>Get a better understanding of how Arduino works</p><p>If you're looking to test your Arduino knowledge, or want to get started with Arduino, this course is perfect for you.Test your understanding of Arduino programming concepts</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p>The test is divided into different levels, so you can start with the basics and progress to more difficult concepts.</p><p>One Arduino Practice Test is the \"Test your Arduino Knowledge\" course.
