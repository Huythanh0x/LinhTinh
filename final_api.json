When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4226804", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Digital Marketing", "title": "Systeme Sales Funnels - Free Sales Funnels Tool Guide", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nick Nyxson", "duration": "null", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "183", "students": "31775", "coupon_code": "60569508D01763450F32", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/systeme_course/?couponCode=60569508D01763450F32", "end_day": "2022-04-01 05:21:00+00:00", "headline": "Systeme - Free Sales Funnel Builder, Email Marketing tool, Blog Builder and Just All-in-one Digital Marketing Tool", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to </em><strong><em>Complete Online Business Marketing Tool - Guide to Systeme!</em></strong></p><p>For a long time, marketers have had to piece together various tools and software tools in order to achieve their goals.

It produces the power that turns the wheels and electricity for lights and other systems.</p><p>Most automobiles are powered by an internal combustion engine. Fuel, usually gasoline or petrol, is burned with air to create gases that expand. A spark plug creates a spark that ignites the gas and makes it burn. This energy moves through cylinders in which pistons slide up and down. They are attached to rods that move a crankshaft. Normal car engines have four to six cylinders but there are also models with eight and sixteen cylinders. The turning movement is passed through the drivetrain to the drive wheels.</p><p>The engine and all parts that carry power to the wheels are called the drivetrain. It includes the transmission, drive shaft, differential, the axles and the drive wheels that move the car. While most cars have drive wheels in the front, some have them in the back. Cars that need to drive over all kinds of ground have a four-wheel drive.</p><p>The transmission controls the speed and torque. When a car travels at a normal speed on a flat road it does not need so much torque to keep it moving, but when you want to start a car from a hill the engine must produce more power. Gears control speed and power of the engine in different driving conditions.</p><p>In cars with manual transmission you have to change gears by pressing down the clutch with your foot and moving a lever. Cars with automatic transmission change gears without control by the driver. Lower gears give the car more torque and speed. When the car moves faster the transmission shifts to higher gears.</p><p>The driveshaft carries the power to the axle which is connected to the wheels. It has several joints which make the axle and wheels moveable as the car drives on uneven and bumpy roads.</p><p>The differential is connected to the rear end of the driveshaft. It lets the wheels turn at different speeds because in curves the outer wheels must travel a greater distance than the inner ones.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "2790370", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Other Teaching & Academics", "title": "RoboAuthor: Content Writing Automation 2022 - Part 2", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "duration": "null", "rating": "3.2", "reviews": "100", "students": "29340", "coupon_code": "41630C6E80B37166BC58", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/roboauthor-content-writing-automation-2020-part-2/?couponCode=41630C6E80B37166BC58", "end_day": "2022-03-31 16:55:00+00:00", "headline": "Let artificial intelligence tools equip you with content writing superpowers in 2022", "description": "<p><strong><em>Welcome to this superb course that will walk you through the future of content creation.&nbsp;Taking a leap from&nbsp;RoboAuthor&nbsp;Part 1, this Part 2 course taught by Digital Marketing&nbsp;Legend Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan and MasterMind Saranya Srinidhi will continue your adventure in content writing to open a new door of opportunities that is incredibly futuristic. </em></strong></p><p>It is undoubtedly one of the most challenging tasks to create content for your digital marketing campaigns.

Our day-to-day&nbsp;thoughts create the beliefs that we process and these beliefs make us who we are (in a good way or in a bad way).&nbsp;</p><p>Our thought process&nbsp;is actually something that we are engaged in every day of our lives, yet we always take it for granted without even acknowledging the fact that whatever we are doing and however we are feeling (emotionally) is totally dependent on our thought process and It is completely in our hand to make a difference in our life with our thinking pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>Changing beliefs/thought processes&nbsp;isn\u2019t easy. Despite what some authors and speakers tell you, deeply ingrained beliefs aren\u2019t going to disappear with one magical technique or method. But if your happiness and success are important to you it can be done.&nbsp;</p><p>In this course, you will learn&nbsp;the complete 'blueprint' to free yourself from the tyranny of thoughts that limit your achievement. The aim of this course is to be thought-provoking and this in return will help you to become aware of your thinking pattern and to control your thoughts instead of being controlled by them...</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, to have a breakthrough in YOUR happiness and emotional well-being...

Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you.

You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career.

Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one.

It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something. Something that you'll run away with and will change your thinking on approaching a character. She was so patient with me as it took me a bit of struggle to get the hang of it, which encouraged me a lot. Coach, I am so grateful for being part of my acting process. I can never take this part for granted. Thank you so much, and may God add you more wisdom to keep showering on us.
