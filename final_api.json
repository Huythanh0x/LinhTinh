Developers across the globe prefer using Kotlin for a range of projects such as data science, server-side or cloud development, etc. The demand for Kotlin is on the rise and it will continue to grow in the years to come. In this post, let\u2019s explore the top five reasons why Kotlin is a great programming language to learn in 2021. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Modern language</strong> </p><p>It is a modern programming language that brings together the best of object-oriented and functional programming. Some of the most promising features of Kotlin include clean compact syntax, security, general-purpose, and more. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Easy to learn</strong> </p><p>Kotlin\u2019s syntax is easy to learn for beginners and it offers a host of powerful features. It can be a great language to upskill for experienced programmers. It has a shallow learning curve especially if you have experience in Python or Java. The programming language is also quite easy for iOS developers as it is based on familiar concepts of modern technology. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Great materials</strong> </p><p>There are ample materials available on Kotlin that learners can leverage to have a good grasp of the programming language. There are numerous courses that a beginner can start with. Most of these courses are self-paced and offer great insights into the programming language. Also, the developer community is quite huge so if learners get stuck or have queries they can always seek solutions from the developer community. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Career prospects</strong> </p><p>Many leading brands use Kotlin for their software and Kotlin skills are highly in demand. If estimates are to be believed, job postings related to Kotlin skills are skyrocketing since 2017 by 1400%. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Community support</strong> </p><p>Kotlin is an open-source language and has a strong community of developers. There are over 200 Kotlin user groups, over 37,000 Kotlinlang slack users, and thousands of other members. The community support is huge in Kotlin and it is constantly growing.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-b.udemycdn.com/2021-09-02_18-59-23-717a99fca80c16f4e81238b30f6f4858/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?secure=wxALYg34NasbUepHrRaj8g%3D%3D%2C1646417893"}, {"course_id": "4418696", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Cryptocurrency & Blockchain", "title": "Complete Course on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Navdeep Yadav", "duration": "null", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "77", "students": "9894", "coupon_code": "BLOCKCHAIN104", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4418696_7838_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-course-on-blockchain-and-crypto-currency/?couponCode=BLOCKCHAIN104", "end_day": "2022-03-09 04:17:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn everything about Blockchain, Smart Contract and Web 3.0", "description": "<p>If you are new to cryptocurrencies and blockchain then you may have some questions in mind such as:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>What are bitcoin and ethereum blockchains?</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How are blocks interlinked with each other in blockchain?</p></li></ul><p>Understanding these questions might be overwhelming but this course will help you understand all the complex topics.

In most Data Science and Machine Learning courses, algorithms are taught without teaching Python or this programming language. However, it is very important to understand language structure in order to apply any discipline including Data Science and Mechanical Learning.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, without understanding Mathematics and Statistics it is impossible to understand how other Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms and techniques work.</p><p><br></p><p>Science and Mechanical Data is a set of complex linked topics. However, we strongly believe in what Einstein once said,</p><p><br></p><p>\"If you can't explain it easily, you didn't understand it well enough.\"</p><p><br></p><p>As a teacher, I constantly strive to reach my goal. This is one comprehensive course in Science and Mechanical Data that teaches you everything you need to learn Science and Mechanical Data using simple examples with great depth.</p><p><br></p><p>As you will see from the preview talks, some of the more complex topics are explained in simple language.</p><p><br></p><p>Some important skills you will learn,</p><p><br></p><p>Python Programming</p><p><br></p><p>Python is listed as the # 1 language for Data Science and Mechanical Data. It is easy to use and rich with various libraries and functions required to perform various Data Science and Machine Learning activities. In addition, it is the most widely used and automated language for the use of many Deep Learning frameworks including Tensorflow and Keras.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Advanced Mathematics Learning Machine</p><p><br></p><p>Mathematics is the foundation of Data Science in general and Learning Machines in particular. Without understanding the meanings of Vectors, Matrices, their operations and understanding Calculus, it is impossible to understand the basics of Data Science and Machine Learning. The Gradient Declaration of Basic Neural Network and Mechanical Learning is built on the foundations of Calculus and Derivatives.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Previous Statistics for Data Science</p><p><br></p><p>It is not enough to know only what you are saying, in the middle, the mode, etc. Advanced Techniques for Science and Mechanical Data such as feature selection, size reduction using PCA are all based on previous Distribution and Statistical Significance calculations. It also helps us to understand the operation of the data and use the appropriate machine learning process to get the best results from various Data Science and Mechanical Learning techniques.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Data recognition</p><p><br></p><p>As they say, the picture costs a thousand words. Data identification is one of the most important methods of Data Science and Mechanical Data and is used for Analytical Data Analysis. In that, we analyze the data visually to identify patterns and styles. We will learn how to create different sites and charts and how to analyze them for all practical purposes. Feature Selection plays an important role in Machine Learning and Visualization Data is its key.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Data processing</p><p><br></p><p>Scientific Data requires extensive data processing. Data Science and Machine Learning specialists spend more than 2/3 of their time analyzing and analyzing data. Data can be noisy and never in good condition. Data processing is one of the most important ways for Data Science and Mechanics to learn to get the best results. We will be using Pandas which is a well-known Python data processing library and various other libraries for reading, analyzing, processing and cleaning data.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Machine learning</p><p><br></p><p>Heart and Soul Data Science is a guessing skill provided by algorithms from the Deep Learning and Learning Machines. Machine learning takes the complete discipline of Data Science ahead of others. We will integrate everything we have learned in previous sections and build learning models for various machines. The key features of Machine Learning are not only ingenuity but also understanding of the various parameters used by Machine Learning algorithms. We will understand all the key parameters and how their values \u200b\u200baffect the outcome in order to build the best machine learning models.</p>", "preview_video": "https://mp4-c.udemycdn.com/2021-09-22_19-16-43-17171ee9c2a7eca3d354ba124b0697e8/2/WebHD_720p.mp4?Expires=1646417985&Signature=i7SPfUP~vED28ELgFwgLDp5zPerxxMd3cdwKMgDYxYIBU1ZL18Lby-RPGUIQhx~yrn3V75UW2mCnMxi93EajQkM3crmKzjGR5kqua9oZztPW-axrXPjqo3tARRffLoiu~hhPahh1aj9hEoYmBCDWlqcL3B4mLBB~Lq-Vl6BbkhPpTh3KddoAO9qMKfe7aLkx2CJuh21eajvV1bceophugCx6dd-AS6aWZl5PUYkWHLy7lvFoXUR5CQM3fGDeJ2UX~vTsaZ5IAQNujD6vpwNsCTqWhACpCRIWB5nHDVMm2YVFw6SIUniOvTps2Scx9lNlYuE5wQLFQ8EPLHzI8b7dGg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAITJV77WS5ZT7262A"}, {"course_id": "3563409", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "Profitable App Development Blueprint for Startups", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Umran Nayani | Entrepreneurship | Innovation | Startups | Strategy |", "duration": "null", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "140", "students": "39595", "coupon_code": "APPDEVPROFIT4U", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3563409_e714_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/profitable-app-development-blueprint-for-startups/?couponCode=APPDEVPROFIT4U", "end_day": "2022-03-09 11:57:00+00:00", "headline": "Uncover the framework and tools to profitably design and develop mobile apps for your Startup.", "description": "<p>Each day thousands of mobile apps are published to the Google Play and Apple App Stores.

This course is a follow-up from the earlier course on <strong>Reverse Engineering &amp; Memory Hacking</strong>. It is the practical application of what you have learnt in the first course. If you think that packing and anti-debugging is good enough to prevent reverse engineering, then you may be in for a surprise. In this course, I&nbsp;will show you how to test the effectiveness of several popular packers by packing crackmes and then reversing them - <strong>without unpacking. </strong></p><p>Traditionally packed programs are unpacked before debugging is carried out. This is because a packed program's file cannot be patched. Much of software protection has centered on making it difficult to unpack programs. However,&nbsp; the important question is: how effective is packing, obfuscation and anti-debugging as a means to prevent reversing? This course explores several packers to find the answers. </p><p>We will do the analysis using a tool called Cheat Engine, which is a prominent tool used by game hackers. This tool could also be used to study and analyze packed program's processes that is running in memory. You will learn how to perform debugging in spite of anti-debugging being implemented. There is no need to unpack and dump memory.&nbsp; Instead of unpacking and then patching the dumped files and fixing IAT (Import Address Table) tables,&nbsp; we will write scripts to hack memory using byte patching using an advanced technique called AOB (Array-Of-Bytes) Injection, by injecting code into code caves (inline memory patching).&nbsp; In this course you will learn how to do all of the above and more.</p><p>At the end of this course you will be able to gauge the effectiveness of software packers, obfuscation and anti-debugging protection and also to have a good idea of how to implement extra countermeasures to improve the security of software.</p><p>In all the practical exercises and walkthroughs, we will use Crackme's which I&nbsp;have written.

This is what brings us to a point that it is not our position but our disposition that determines our success.</p><p>Now, once you are standing in front of the person you want to impress, you want to make sure that you connect with them on a personal as well as on a professional level. Ahh!! It is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a gift to give somebody your undivided attention and really share with them and exchange. </p><p><br></p><p>And the way we connect with somebody is the set of tools and techniques that you will learn in this course. Well! Doesn't it feel very awful to receive a limp handshake from somebody? It's the extension of your energy, and when you cut that energy off and kind of dangle it meekly with the person in front of you creates a disconnect. </p><p><br></p><p>So, make sure you master all these techniques and attract the feelings of openness and positive vibes all around you\u2026 So that anyone in this world genuinely wants to connect with you and be friends with you for the rest of their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will empower you with the entire blueprint, which can transform you into a success magnet.

I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover the customer journey to purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find your IDEAL customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to HONE IN ON YOUR PERFECT CUSTOMER. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be sharing POWERFUL INSIDER TARGETING STRATEGIES that will SUPERPOWER your custom and lookalike audience set up.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting the most out of the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly.
