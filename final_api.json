SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.&nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.&nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.</p><p>If you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO)&nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing<strong> \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"J. Selva Antony Santosh\"</strong> is for you!&nbsp;This quiz also has the room for explanatory answers that it provides.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.

Picture a version of yourself that is relaxed, at ease, comfortable and confident whether you\u2019re talking to a new potential friend, a love interest, or a potential employer or high-profile executive.</p><p>With the right skills you can speak to people in a way that leaves them understanding you. With this type of communication skill you become memorable and can have an impact on other people. This means they\u2019re listening to what you have to say. You can impress in a job interview, be the person everyone wants to talk to at a social event, be an understanding partner without being walked over, connect better with your children and family members, and earn the respect of colleagues and others around you.</p><p>If this sounds great to you, then I\u2019d like to invite you to join on me on this Communication Mini Masterclass. I\u2019m Jayme Wium, a communication and relationship counsellor with hands on communication coaching experience. What I want to tell you today is that there\u2019s nothing stopping you from becoming a clear, open, and highly effective communicator. The only thing stopping you is your own mind. Often it\u2019s what we think we <em>can\u2019t </em>do are the biggest stumbling blocks towards our success. With this course, I will help you overcome the stumbling blocks that are holding you back from becoming the best possible version of yourself in every conversation, interaction, and encounter. And once you know and absorb the tips and communication hacks I am going to share with you, you won\u2019t need to prepare for conversations and encounters \u2013 it will come naturally.</p><p>People aren\u2019t born natural communicators. If you think about it, you couldn\u2019t even speak when you were born. Communication is a learned skill. And you can learn that skill right here with me.</p><p>Firstly, you\u2019re going to come across as confident, relaxed and comfortable in all types of communication scenarios \u2013 because you genuinely will be. Secondly, you will communicate in a way that others understand you and can relate to you. Thirdly, you\u2019ll communicate in a way that makes you memorable, likeable, and attractive. And fourthly, you\u2019ll enjoy communicating with other people because it won\u2019t make you feel awkward, uncomfortable or out of place. And of course, you\u2019ll be able to influence people into taking action in the way you want them to, which means you always get what you want out of your communication efforts.</p><p>After the final video recording, you will be required to complete the rest of the course via the printed downloadable documents. I&nbsp;have included worksheets, exercises, and several study articles to help expand on the tips and hacks included in the video footage. The rest of the course content is provided in printed media, for your convenience and for self-study.
