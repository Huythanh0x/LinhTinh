Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting.

This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you.

Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

I have appreciated her commitment and her ability to inspire, challenge and support young talent. My daughter has greatly benefited from the coaching sessions and precious advice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Margaret Leitch</strong></p><p>I would recommend Sylvia very, very highly as an acting career coach. Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one. The day I got to join her class and be taught. I learnt so much that I don't think I would have learnt anywhere else. My best part was the Archetypes. This deepens my character relationship with me. It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something. Something that you'll run away with and will change your thinking on approaching a character. She was so patient with me as it took me a bit of struggle to get the hang of it, which encouraged me a lot. Coach, I am so grateful for being part of my acting process. I can never take this part for granted. Thank you so much, and may God add you more wisdom to keep showering on us. I can't wait to make a film with you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>At this point, we both know that Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery is precisely what you've been looking for to take your passion for acting to the Next Level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It's precisely what you want.

Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you. And the good news is that\u2026<br></p><p><strong>Now You Too Can Protect Yourself From not Becoming Insecure about your Acting Career and Quitting before breaking into the Industry.</strong><br></p><p>Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p>That's right, you no longer have to lie awake at night, worrying about how to nail the next role you want to go for.</p><p><br></p><p>Because when you know these Acting foundation secrets, the exact methods and techniques for consistently confident about your acting, mastering the craft and avoiding feeling disempowered, out of control or lost in performance, you'll finally have peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That's because you know exactly what you are doing every time you approach a new role or go to an audition. You know how to dazzle with your performance while having great fun doing what your heart desires.<br></p><p><strong>Introducing: Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery with Joan of Arc)</strong><br></p><p>The #1 way to prevent unauthentic acting. You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career. The skills that you will learn will provide you with clarity on the path to your career success.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at what they're saying about Learning Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery:<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p><p>First of all, these courses are powered by an amazing lady. Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.

Just look at what others are saying:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kathryn Raphael</strong></p><p>Sylvia Love Johnson is a force of nature with her passion and ability to break down acting techniques. I have appreciated her commitment and her ability to inspire, challenge and support young talent. My daughter has greatly benefited from the coaching sessions and precious advice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Margaret Leitch</strong></p><p>I would recommend Sylvia very, very highly as an acting career coach. Her coaching and mentoring of my son Ross,13, has been top drawer. Sylvia is so clever and talented and has an immense wealth of knowledge and experience to share. Her gentle, cheerful and bubbly personality is just perfect for drawing a young, occasionally awkward person like Ross out of himself and help him believe anything is possible.</p><p>Sylvia nurtures the relationship with Ross and myself to be the best supportive unit that we can be, and we both love her to bits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faiz Francis Ouma</strong></p><p>Now, if there's something beautiful that has happened to my career Sylvia Love Johnson is one. The day I got to join her class and be taught. I learnt so much that I don't think I would have learnt anywhere else. My best part was the Archetypes. This deepens my character relationship with me. It gets me really close to them. This is something any actor would want. I am so grateful for this opportunity and glad to have met you.</p><p>I would recommend any actor out there to pass through here. Trust me, you will learn something. Something that you'll run away with and will change your thinking on approaching a character. She was so patient with me as it took me a bit of struggle to get the hang of it, which encouraged me a lot. Coach, I am so grateful for being part of my acting process. I can never take this part for granted. Thank you so much, and may God add you more wisdom to keep showering on us. I can't wait to make a film with you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>At this point, we both know that Learn Method Acting, Characterisation and Monologue Mastery is precisely what you've been looking for to take your passion for acting to the Next Level.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>It's precisely what you want.

Founded in 2013 our mission is to spread the love for programming. To achieve this, we're working hard on providing content that will help people build a solid foundation in those subjects.</p></li><li><p>WHAT TO EXPECT</p><p>This course will help you to master the foundation and know-how to solve problems with Python code.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; 2. The content in a nutshell</p><ul><li><p>WHAT EACH UNIT IS ABOUT</p><p>This course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs. We are going to do that in the context of building a web search engine.</p><p>Uint 1 will teach you the python grammar and show you how to use variables, strings, and\tsome Python built-in functions to work on them in order to create a web crawler that makes use of those.</p><p>Unit 2 will take you in more depth in using procedures, loops, and the logical constructs in order to add more functionality to the crawler built-in unit 1.</p><p>Unit 3 is about managing data through mastering the use of the different data types to be able to create the search engine index. </p><p>Our biggest goal tho is to learn about computer science, So unit 4 focuses on teaching you how computers store data and how to be cost-effective when doing that. In addition to understanding the foundation of networks and data management.</p><p>By the end of unit 5, you'll have a better understanding of how programs run and how to implement a hash table for our search engine. </p><p>Unit 6 will extend the grammar we introduced in unit 1 and will show you how to get the best result for a search query.</p><p>If the course gets much interaction and feedback, we'll work on units to demonstrate how to code real-world Python applications </p></li></ul><p>That's the content in a nutshell. I hope you're as excited as I'm to start this learning journey, so just the enrollment today and thank me later.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Who is the course for? </p><ul><li><p>BEGINNERS WHO WANT TO LEARN IN AN ACADEMIC WAY\t\t</p><p>This course is designed for extreme beginners with no computer science or programming background, it'll help them get up and running with Python and give them a foundational understanding of computer science concepts.</p></li><li><p>NOT FOR EXPERIENCED PROGRAMMERS\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If you're an experienced programmer or you already master Python and computer science concepts, then please do not take this course, unless you'd want a quick refresh on the Python programming foundation</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; 4. Learning objectives</p><ul><li><p>MASTER THE FOUNDATION OF PROGRAMMING\t</p><p>This course focuses on helping extreme beginners in mastering computer science and python programming theory, in order to be able to solve coding problems or develop their own applications.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; 5.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. </p><p>Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. </p><p>In this introduction to computer programming course, you\u2019ll learn and practice key computer science concepts. You\u2019ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you\u2019ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own programs.</p><p>This Computer science and programming using python course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.</p><p>Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece. And those steps can be executed by a computer.</p><p>In this course, we will not get into everything that you need to be a programmer, but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be <strong>fluently</strong> programming in Python and you'll be so good at Python that you can get a job or use the language professionally.</p><p>You'll cover all that you need to be an accomplished Python Programmer.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. </p><p>Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. </p><p>In this introduction to computer programming course, you\u2019ll learn and practice key computer science concepts. You\u2019ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you\u2019ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own programs.</p><p>This Computer science and programming using python course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.</p><p>Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece. And those steps can be executed by a computer.</p><p>In this course, we will not get into everything that you need to be a programmer, but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be <strong>fluently</strong> programming in Python and you'll be so good at Python that you can get a job or use the language professionally.</p><p>You'll cover all that you need to be an accomplished Python Programmer.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report.

When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "3402012", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Finance", "title": "Corporate Finance", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "duration": "9810", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "339", "students": "48984", "coupon_code": "54D91E3B33EC427D24FA", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3402012_cc91.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/corporate-finance/?couponCode=54D91E3B33EC427D24FA", "end_day": "2022-03-31 05:26:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn corporate finance from a practicing CPA Certified Public Accountant", "description": "<p>We will learn how to read financial statements and how to use them for decision making.</p><p>A primary tool we will use is ratio analysis.

It is also about developing empathy and our ability to form deep relationships with others.</p><p>What is an emotionally intelligent child like?</p><p>Children who have developed their emotional intelligence are aware of their feelings and have developed the vocabulary to name the feelings they are experiencing; usually able to understand what has caused them to feel a certain way and explain it. As well as to develop strategies to deal with the feelings in an appropriate way; able to take other people's feelings into account in other situations.</p><p>Anyone who has tried to think clearly when they are upset, angry or very excited will understand how much power emotions can have over us. Emotions are a part of being human and our toddlers, children and adolescents need help and support to equip them with the tools to deal with their big feelings. All emotions are important and there is no shame to be had from feeling different emotions but, it is the way that children release those emotions that can be problematic for parents and carers and create power struggles. Understanding, labelling and being in control of emotions leads to happier children who feel safe and secure.</p><p>Ignoring or denying how your child feels can cause further upset. As parents, it is natural to sometimes try to be positive when children are feeling negative emotions by telling them 'not to worry' or 'it'll be OK. However, although well-intended, this is a contrast to your child's emotional state and can lead to them feeling misunderstood, affecting your connection with your child. Instead, try mirroring and labelling your child's emotion for them with a calm tone of voice and empathy.</p>", "preview_video": "", "locale": "English"}, {"course_id": "4453764", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "TILFND V4: ITIL 4 Foundation Practice Tests 2022", "level": "All Levels", "author": "It Exam Academy", "duration": "0", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "4", "students": "4386", "coupon_code": "1BBB8187405D9F03A3DF", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/4453764_9768.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tilfnd-v4-itil-4-foundation-practice-tests-2022-a/?source=coursemetry.com&couponCode=1BBB8187405D9F03A3DF", "end_day": "2022-04-01 15:31:00+00:00", "headline": "Get 100% ready to pass the ITIL 4 Foundation Certification Exam", "description": "<p><strong>Description</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Official exam information:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Test taking options: Online / Local test center</em></p></li><li><p><em>Time to complete: 60 mins</em></p></li><li><p><em>Total number of questions asked: 40</em></p></li><li><p><em>Passing Score: 65%</em></p></li><li><p>Multiple choice examination questions</p></li></ul><p>What is ITIL?

Every year, 99% of Actors quit due to discouragement and depression in the UK alone. Of course, it's obvious why only 1% make it into the Industry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Over 60% Of Actresses and 40% of Actors suffer from anxiety, which doesn't even count the people who do not report it.</strong><br></p><p><strong>If you are passionate and serious about your Acting Career, then you've probably thought about this before. You probably realise that you're a statistic waiting to happen.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You've probably realised what a nightmare it would be being passionate about a profession but not having the means or contacts to access and learn the job you love 100% masterfully. The lack of confidence and lack of clarity comes inbuilt with the profession. The feeling of inadequacy at times. The challenge that it is working on complex new roles. When one feels seriously intimidated by other actors who seem to know exactly what they are doing and the devastating effects that all these can have on you.<br></p><p>And it probably scares you out of your mind. I know the feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>If so, you're NOT alone.</p><p><br></p><p>And you're not over-reacting. This is a genuine and severe problem, especially for Actors, even though it has never been addressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Worse yet, even people who try to keep up to date with coaching by joining amateur theatre community groups aren't safe. And those who take University degrees in Performing Arts and Acting may actually be doing more harm than good because mainstream courses are designed for the masses; they are impersonal and generalised.</p><p><br></p><p>You are a unique individual; you are not the masses. This is why you will find that all my courses are designed to help you as an amazing, powerful human being. I want you to see your power. You certainly don't want to find yourself in a place where you feel desperately powerless because you feel ashamed of not reaching your absolute best in every performance. And not knowing how to control the outcome you want.</p><p><br></p><p>But the worse consequence of not learning to master the craft is that you will produce stale, forced and \"fake\" performances that might be entertaining at best but will never reach your audience's heart and will not make an impact. Making it all meaningless. All art forms need to have meaning. That's what makes them art.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm speaking from personal experience. I nearly quit, without even realising that I was giving up my dreams, even after doing a BA in Acting at University.</p><p><br></p><p>It's overwhelming when it happens. You really feel like there is nothing you can do when you don't know what you are doing wrong. And it's frightening when you feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied with your work. Some actors feel desperate, and they begin to shy away and quit slowly, inwardly, so they start to come across as very insecure at auditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The point is, allowing this vicious circle in your career can actually turn your life upside down. It took me four years, right out of University, to recover.</p><p><br></p><p>I think it takes most people a lot longer \u2013 maybe even forever until they quit. And the road to recovery is never easy because there is almost no guidance, direction, and support available for Actors.</p><p><br></p><p>You don't want this to happen to you. And the good news is that\u2026<br></p><p><strong>Now You Too Can Protect Yourself From not Becoming Insecure about your Acting Career and Quitting before breaking into the Industry.</strong><br></p><p>Guaranteed!</p><p><br></p><p>That's right, you no longer have to lie awake at night, worrying about how to nail the next role you want to go for.</p><p><br></p><p>Because when you know these Acting foundation secrets, the exact methods and techniques for consistently confident about your acting, mastering the craft and avoiding feeling disempowered, out of control or lost in performance, you'll finally have peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That's because you know exactly what you are doing every time you approach a new role or go to an audition.

You are on your way to achieving mastery.</p><p><br></p><p>This course has helped over 3000 people solve acting anxiety, prevent them from seriously doubting their skills and abilities, from becoming depressed and eventually quitting their dream career.

Sylvia really cares about her message, projects and her students. I have been so impressed by the support and positivity of both my son and myself.</p><p>I first came across the Monologue Mastery courses when my son applied for one of the films Sylvia was producing. Her input has really inspired him. He followed all her guidance and created a selection of monologues so he could show a variety of aspects of his acting ability to create different characters. He has embraced her warm-up techniques and is much more confident in the whole audition process. We have many conversations based on Sylvia's things, and I genuinely feel that this information has helped him fine-tune his film and Theatre goals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isaac</strong></p><p>I was lucky enough to become part of her Monologue Mastery Acting Course.</p><p>I would like to say how much I really believe Sylvia cares about her students. Every email we wrote and the questions we had were answered straight away. She has really supported me towards my goals, and her wise words have helped clarify my goals.</p><p>As a young actor, I am always excited to go to auditions. Being part of the Monologue Mastery Acting Course has improved my preparation 100%. Sylvia encouraged me to build up a selection of monologues rather than just having one that I used repeatedly. This has improved how I feel when I get to an audition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Daniella Raphael</strong></p><p>The course is going great! I'm really enjoying studying The monologue, and I was fascinated by your journey in this Industry.</p><p>I found it very interesting learning about the archetypes and how every character and person fit into mainly one of them. This has really helped me connect with characters from my own monologues, and I will definitely use this in the future.</p><p>I really appreciate the Actors Inspirational Journal. I loved the layout of all the pages with the inspirational quotes and pictures, my favourite being: \"Without wonder and insight, acting is just a business. With it, it becomes creation.\" By Bete Davis. I look forward to experimenting with this journal. Many Thanks.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen, if people like Isaac can go from feeling insecure to feeling 100% in control with their acting career with newly gained clarity and direction, just imagine how well this course will work for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imagine what it will feel like to finally know you are one of those Intimidating Actors who knows precisely what they are doing with any new role they choose.
